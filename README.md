# Course-Registration

# Project features:
  - User can select courses not more then 20 credits.
  - Shows selected items in a list.
  - Prevent any duplication in the selected list and give us a warning toast.
  - Users can see The total selected credit and total price of all selected coures. 

# management of the state in this assignment project:
- In this project, I managed state using the "useState" hook. Data is passed between components by sending and receiving objects and functions from parent to child components. These objects are destructured and dynamically used in the UI.
